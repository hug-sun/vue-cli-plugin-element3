## Inspired by
https://github.com/ElementUI/vue-cli-plugin-element

### Install

First you need to install `@vue/cli` globally (follow the instructions [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/)).

Then create a project and add the Element plugin:

```
vue create my-app
cd my-app
vue add element3
```

You'll be asked some questions regarding how Element is configured in your project. After that, you're good to go.
